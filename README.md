# The Strictly Curse
A first project in web-scraping, with the aim of hypothesis-testing whether the divorce rate of celebrities is increased by their participation on the show Strictly Come Dancing.

Packages & Libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- requests
- BeautifulSoup
- math

Next Steps:
- Add some data visualisation: potentially some graphs to show the difference.
- It'd be a different project completely, but I might have enough data to cluster the contestants to predict their success?
